        <p>A home page is a default or front page of a website. It is the first page that visitors see when they load your main URL. You know what a homepage is. We don’t need to go on forever about what it is. The more important discussion is around the purpose of a homepage. Your homepage is an opportunity to clearly and succinctly define what exactly you do while piquing interest. Not everyone browsing the internet will land on your homepage the first time they visit your site, but it needs to provide value nonetheless. If you have recently launched a new product or service, your homepage would be a great place to display that new information. That way, even if they get to your site through a blog post searching for a solution, they can come to the homepage and find an easy way to purchase your product or service.Let’s face it. The only reason your website visitors are coming to your website is because they are looking for something.

            They come because, #1 they have a problem and #2 they need a solution to that problem. And they believe you can help them overcome their challenge or achieve a certain goal.
            
            That’s why when you write homepage copy, you must always highlight the features and benefits associated with your brand.
            
            If your visitors don’t immediately see what they’ll gain by partnering with you, they’ll quickly move on to your competitors. This is why benefit-driven homepage copy helps in improving conversions.
            
            Also note that it’s not enough to just list all the features of your product or service. You need to show how those features translate to actual benefits for your audience.</p>
