            services page could be a great place to segment the visitors by their role, industry, platform, job title, etc. Domo did just that on its solutions page (which I still consider being a variation of a services page).

            This approach not only enables Domo to analyze the quantities of people picking each of these choices, but it helps tailor their solutions as well. If they know its site isn't getting business from those in the healthcare industry, maybe it’s a vertical they shouldn't try to aim for. Or, they may find manufacturing to be the best industry they attract which could open an opportunity for improvements in their product.
            
            This approach to user segmentation enables each user group coming to the website to have a more catered experience as they determine whether or not Domo solves their pain points.Sometimes you’ll find yourself overwhelmed with the amount of services you offer and you may struggle to know how to outline them for your users to understand.

            iVision knew exactly what to do when they were assembling their services. They organized them under three categories which contain the sub-services within each. This approach allows users to easily see exactly what iVision can do while giving them the option to further explore the services on separate pages.Services pages should contain at least 250–500 words of content that provide relevant information and describe how your firm can help solve readers’ problems. Potential clients may enter your website through services pages – and not necessarily the home page – so the content should clearly identify your firm’s value proposition or edge over the competition. Readers have limited attention spans, so where possible make it easier for visitors to scan your content with headlines, subheadings and lists. A few best practices to keep in mind</p>
