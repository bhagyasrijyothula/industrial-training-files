            An About Us page doesn’t have to be hard work. But it should do a great job at giving the customers an insight into the inner workings of your company highlighting the whats, hows, and whys of your brand. So be honest and pick the words wisely. Most importantly, don’t forget to be human.

          Let your creativity flow and don’t be afraid to let a little emotion come out. The more real you are, the easier it’s to connect with you and your brand. And that’s what will help your brand name stick in the head of your customers.Page content can be displayed as text, links, images, audio, animation or videos among other things. Search engines have a limited ability to recognize images, animation, video and audio. In these instances, search engines use file names or alt attributes to determine the contents of a page. Therefore, important information needs to be given in text-form to make it accessible to search engines.Their About Us page stands out by showcasing some of their unique and creative projects.

          No number of words could hope to tell one of their potential clients nearly as much as these pictures can.
          
          In this case, the 25 pictures featured on Band’s About Us page are worth much more than the 170 actual words you’ll read on the page.
          
          The magical visuals and overall simple look and feel make this About Us page one of our top picks.</p>
